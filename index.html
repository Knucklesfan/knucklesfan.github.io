    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/knucklesfan/uilapi">UIL-API</a>: Complete reimplementation of the UIL scores website into an API</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/knucklesfan/sdltris">Knuxfan's Tetriminos</a>: My own hand-made version of Tetris, entirely coded in C++ using the SDL2 library. My first "big" game that wasn't built in a pre-existing engine.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.knuxstuff.com/KnuxfanSpelling/">Knuxfan Spelling</a>: Fun little browser-based spelling bee game. Made for a friend in less than 24 hours!</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Knucklesfan/KnuxfanRadio">Knuxfan Radio</a>: A visualizer for PulseAudio based systems that was intended to be expanded into a car radio. Unfortunately, the great global chip shortage kinda killed those dreams.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Knucklesfan/Chip8Deluxe">Chip8Deluxe</a>: A mostly completed emulator of the somewhat real computer, Chip8! This was my first experiment with Chip8 emulation, with my next goal being Gameboy Emulation some day in the future.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.knuxstuff.com/Sus-Cube/">3D Sus Cube</a>: Joke that might've gone too far. But WebGL was fun to play with!</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.knuxstuff.com/falcondance/">FalconDance</a>: Basically 3D Sus Cube but funnier. But threejs was fun to play with!</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Knucklesfan/Knuxfan3D/">Breaking Castle Wolfenstein (Alternate Title: DOOM but it's in Los Pollos Hermanos from Breaking Bad)</a>: Walter White themed Wolf3D clone that got too serious. Still working on this project!</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Knucklesfan/CPP-Tree-Fractal-Experiment">Tree Fractal Experiment</a>: My first C++ project! I never ported this one to Makefile, so it won't compile under Linux but I was ultimately really proud of this project</li>
