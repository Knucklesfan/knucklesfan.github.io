          <h1>Low level programmer</h2>
          <p>I've worked with both Microcontrollers and Servers alike.</p>
          <p>I have experience developing backend software that interfaces with databases like MariaDB, SQLlite, Amazon's DynamoDB, and have experience normalizing data and creating databases that last.</p>
          <p>C++, C, Java, Golang, PHP, Python, Rust, Dart, and even working directly with Assembly are some of the languages I am performant in, and I have been working with C++ for over 10 years, alongside Java.</p>
          <p>I have hardware experience, having built a few of my own custom PCBs, and custom-built IOT devices for my own personal home usage.</p>

          <h1>Front-end works, too!</h2>
          <p>I've done plenty of Front-end related projects as well. I've made web applications using React, I've made projects with Express.js and Spring alike, and have made several applications using Flutter.</p>
          <p>I have experience working in a professional setting with ReactJS, Konva, Svelte, Zustand, and Vite pushing production-ready code multiple times a week.</p>
          <p>I also have experience working with Dart, Swift, Kotlin, QT and GTK4.
          <p>I've also got a lot of experience developing user experiences with no framework at all! I'm skilled with OpenGL, SDL, or just straight up rendering to a framebuffer. As long as it has pixels, I can render to it.</p>

            <h1>Web Experienced</h1>
            <p>I've worked on several web related projects, and have worked with ReactJS and Express for over three years.
              I also am familiar with working with older codebases, including those running JQuery or PHP.
              I can work with web technologies such as WebGL and WebASM, and enjoy working with direct HTML. No static site generator or React necessary!
              This entire side was handed-coded, from scratch using no imported or external Javascript or CSS.

            <h1>I can do IT too!</h1>
            <p>I have plenty of experience running my own servers, and have historically ran infastructure for people on a commission basis.
              I am familiar with running Linux and Windows servers alike, and have a special interest in running Linux servers. I am familiar with Docker, Kubernetes, Proxmox, and Ceph. I run over 30 services, either for myself or as hosting for friends, and maintain 4 datasites. I have installations, or run several Linux distros (and other unix-y stuff!) including but not limited to Debian, Fedora Server, Arch, Ubuntu Server, Alpine Linux, FreeBSD, OpnSense and of course Proxmox.
